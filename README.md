#Youtube-Transcript-Summarizer

Project Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is an integration of web development and the very emerging technology, Machine Learning. This Project aims to provide summarized documentation of a video that are too long to be watched. Today education is more dependent on online sources rather than the offline source, and no one has much time to spent on lecture videos that are too long to watch. So, to resolve this, there should be a tool which can provide a summarization of the video and therefor save time.

Problem and Solution Statement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enormous number of video recordings are being created and shared on the YouTube throughout the day. It becomes really difficult to spend time in watching such videos which may have a longer duration than expected and sometimes our efforts may become futile if we arenâ€™t able to find relevant information out of it. Summarizing transcripts of such videos will allows us to quickly look out for the important patterns in the video and helps us to save time and efforts to go through the whole content of the video.

Implementation strategy
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So basically, it will be a web application, having an option to copy to current URL of the video being selected. After providing the link, it will access the transcript of the particular audio using the YouTube transcript API and then the transcript will be provided to a machine learning model will in return provide the summarized text of the transcript. The summarized text would be downloadable by the user.

Tech Stack used
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frontend:

HTML: Markup language used for structuring the content of your web pages.
CSS: Styling language used for designing the visual appearance of your web pages.
JavaScript: Programming language used for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to your web pages.

Backend:

Python: Programming language used for the server-side logic of your application.
Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python that helps with routing requests, handling responses, and building APIs.

NLP Packages:

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A popular Python library for NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, tagging, and more.
spaCy: Another Python library for NLP, known for its efficient and fast processing capabilities.
Other NLP packages: Depending on your specific requirements, you may have used additional NLP libraries like Transformers or Hugging Face's libraries for fine-tuning and utilizing pre-trained models.

GPT API:

GPT-4 API: OpenAI's API that provides access to the GPT-4 language model for generating human-like text. You would have integrated this API into your application to perform the summarization task.

YouTube Transcript API:

YouTube API: Specifically, the YouTube Transcript API allows you to extract the transcripts of YouTube videos. This API enables you to fetch the necessary data to summarize the video content.
